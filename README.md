## Documentation
### Loading the script  
The currently working version is in `script.js`  
#### There are two main ways to run this script:

* **Manual Mode (Excuting in DevTools Console)**  
    * Open up to the current list task. The standard keybind is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> to open DevTools.  
    * Navigate to the console section (this will look slightly different on all browsers)  
    * Copy and paste the script from `script.js` into the console  
    * Before starting the task type `collect()` and then press enter in the console. Then begin the task  
    * Now in the task type `start(100)` in the console and press enter to begin the script  
      ###### Note: the 100 is just how many milliseconds it will take to answer the question. You can use any number you like
**This is a temporary solution. You will have to manually enter each the script time you refresh or open a new page.**
